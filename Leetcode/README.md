If you haven't heard of AlgoKitty, it's an app that I built lately to make practicing coding easier. [ProductHunt Page here](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/algokitty).

This is a repo where I post my junk gists (solutions to coding problems). I'll try to make it my habit to actually practice algo now that my app is finished ðŸ‘€
